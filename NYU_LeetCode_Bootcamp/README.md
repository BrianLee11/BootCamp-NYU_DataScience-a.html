Students collaborated in groups of 4-5 to work on real-world projects. Project examples include:

1. **Scholarly Insight**: A web application to search and browse scholarly articles using the arXiv API.
2. **DineWise**: A restaurant comparison and review platform using the Yelp API.
3. **Movie Magic**: A movie and TV show discovery platform using the TMDb API.
4. **Congress Tracker**: A web application to track U.S. legislative data using the Congress API.
5. **Crypto Tracker**: A cryptocurrency tracking and portfolio management tool using the CoinGecko API.

### Project Timeline
- **Week 1**: Team formation, API exploration
- **Weeks 2-4**: Backend development
- **Week 5**: Mid-program presentation
- **Weeks 6-7**: Frontend development, feature finalization
- **Week 8**: Deployment, final testing
